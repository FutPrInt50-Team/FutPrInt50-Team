Hi, we are the @FutPrInt50-Team, the team behind @FutPrInt50,

FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 is an EU funded collaborative research project set out to identify and develop technologies and configurations that will accelerate the entry-into-service 
of a commercial hybrid-electric aircraft in a class of up to 50 seats by 2035/40.

With a strong focus on the deep decarbonisation of aviation, FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 researchers aim to develop promising modelling and simulation tools, innovative aircraft electrification 
technologies and a common roadmap for technology and regulation for this class of hybrid-electric aircraft. An aircraft level analysis towards identifying key technologies for 
a future demonstrator in this market segment will be also performed during the three-year course of the project.

FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 focuses on energy storage, energy recovery and the thermal management of hybrid systems. In addition to improving existing technologies, it will research and share 
an open-source tool for designing new hybrid-electric aircraft, hybrid-electric aircraft designs and reference data sets.

Besides lower CO2 aviation footprint, FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 aims also to minimize propeller noise emissions.  A new type of hybrid-electric 50-seat class aircraft being more fuel and noise 
efficient than current regional aircrafts could contribute to open up new point-to-point connections between smaller cities at lower infrastructure costs than rail or road 
transportation.

FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 will be implemented thanks to a highly competent international consortium that brings together a mix of expertise - one OEM (Embraer SA with teams in Brazil and its 
R&T branch in Europe – Embraer Research and Technology Europe, at Airholding, SA), two SMEs (ADSE, EASN) and 11 Universities and research organisations (University of Stuttgart, 
Cranfield University, TU Delft, CEA (Atomic and Alternative Energies Commission), University Niccolo Cusano, University of Illinois, TSaGI, GosNIIAS, CIAM, NRC, MAI) - abridging 
the EU with UK, Russia, USA and Brazil. FᴜᴛPʀIɴᴛ50 receives support also from an Advisory Board that includes EASA and ensures cooperation with Canada.
